# Alienware Arena Helper Reloaded

![options and notification in the bottom right](https://github.com/marcodallagatta/userscripts/blob/main/alienware-arena-helper-reloaded/options.jpg?raw=true)


This is an userscript to make earning ARP on [Alienware Arena (AWA)](https://www.alienwarearena.com/) a bit easier without triggering any automation-detection system than could potentially lead to an account ban, as it is mostly an informative userscript and not a 'macro' one. The project was originall forked from the long-unmantained [Alienware Arena Helper](https://github.com/thomas-ashcraft/alienware_arena_helper) usescript, to which I've added new AWA ways to earn points, removed old ones, and generally made the code a bit cleaner by removing dependencies such as jQuery.

## Features

- Notifies about Daily Quest still uncompleted*.
- Notifies about Twitch watching points stil to earn.
- Notifies about time spent on AWA stil to earn.
- Abilities to remove some parts of AWA to make it lighter and faster.
- Automatically opens Twitch stream from Twitch AWA page.
- Easy to customize with an option panel.
- Easy to edit modular code.

*(I've monitored the website for a couple of months to get most of the keywords, but some might still be missing, in this case the notification will just direct to the forum)
