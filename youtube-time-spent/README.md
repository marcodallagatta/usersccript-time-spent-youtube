# Time Spent on YouTube Userscript

![preview](https://github.com/marcodallagatta/userscripts/blob/main/youtube-time-spent/preview.jpg?raw=true)

A friend asked me to make a simple userscript to show how long she spends on YouTube every day.
I decided to publish it here since it could easily be adapted to other websites without changing the logic.

The script refreshes every 15 seconds only when the YouTube tab is actually active. To make it count time even in background just change the `background` variable to `true`. The time it resets can also be configured inside the script.
